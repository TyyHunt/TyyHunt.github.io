After completing the Flatiron School's curriculum I am excited to continue my learning in my new field but also on my own.  Flatiron School has helped my gain the confidence and foundation to take this career as far as I am willing to go.  For me that means working towards being a team lead and working towards training the next generation of developers.

While I found everything intriguing, I found myself spending more time in the Front End Development than I did in the Back End.  While I know that creating a strong Back End is the foundation of every application  it did not hold my interest as much as Front End Development did.  After I had all my code in place for an application I would spend a large amount of extra time in CSS or JavaScript making sure that my application looked clean and user friendly.  I hope is that this passion and understanding of Front-End Development will lead me to finding a career with a similar job title.  I would love to spend more time diving deep into the capabilities of React and JavaScript itself.

With the Flatiron Career Event coming up in two weeks I am going to be spending a majority of time shoring up my understanding of all languages given by flatiron as well as praticing my technical interview skills.  I am extremely excited for the opportunity to be apart of this event and it adds more onto why Flatiron school is worth the time and monetary insvetment that comes along with this intensive bootcamp.  

It is my aspiration to be apart of a social media of creative design company working on either my Front End of Full Stack capabilities.  I know that Flatiron has primed me for success but the overall outcome now is in my hands.  It is going to be a transition from structured learning to a self motivated learning that I have not used in a while.  I know that the urge for success that Flatiron has given me will guide me in my extended learning and job searching.

Overall, I just wanted to thank Flatiron for the opportunity to be apart of this program as it as launched me forward in my progress of making development a career.
